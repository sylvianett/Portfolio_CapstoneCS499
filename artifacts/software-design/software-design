    <h2>Artifact Overview: SYLTrack (Mobile Application)</h2>
    <p>
      SYLTrack is a mobile application designed to help users track weight entries and progress toward goals. For CS 499, I selected
      this artifact to demonstrate professional software engineering through maintainable architecture, consistent navigation, and
      scalable data handling. This enhancement work focused on strengthening the foundation of the application so that new features and
      visual improvements can be added on top of a stable structure.

    <h2>Why This Artifact Is Included</h2>
    <p>
      I included SYLTrack in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates real-world software development skills: building a multi-screen
      application, improving navigation and user flow, and enhancing data handling to support future growth. This artifact also shows my
      ability to improve an existing codebase based on code review findings and apply professional practices like separation of concerns,
      maintainability, and scalability.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Architecture improvements:</strong> strengthened the overall structure and organization to support scalability.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistent navigation:</strong> introduced a centralized dashboard (SYLBoard) and a persistent bottom navigation bar.</li>
      <li><strong>User-based data:</strong> improved handling so weight entries are tied to authenticated users.</li>
      <li><strong>Goal tracking + insights:</strong> stored goals persistently and surfaced summary progress (recent weight, goal progress).</li>

    <h2>Enhancement Summary (Milestone Two)</h2>
    <p>
      For Milestone Two, I intentionally focused on strengthening architecture, functionality, and scalability rather than visual branding.
      The primary enhancements included adding the SYLBoard dashboard, improving navigation consistency, and enhancing data handling and
      summaries to provide more meaningful insight to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      I deferred advanced theming and branding elements (logos/icons) until later to ensure the application foundation remains stable,
      secure, and maintainable before polishing the presentation layer.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Enhancing SYLTrack reinforced the importance of building a strong foundation before focusing on visual polish. I learned that
      navigation consistency and clean architecture have a major impact on the usability and maintainability of an application.
      One challenge was balancing improvements to user flow with keeping the code organized and scalable. Overall, this enhancement
      strengthened my ability to revise an existing software solution with professional standards in mind.
