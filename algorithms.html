    <h2>Artifact: CS 320 Appointment Service</h2>
    <p>
      This artifact is a Java service layer project created in CS 320 that supports creating, updating, and deleting appointment objects
      while enforcing required validation rules. The project includes unit tests written with JUnit to verify the service logic and validate
      that invalid input is handled correctly.

    <h2>Why This Artifact Belongs in My ePortfolio</h2>
    <p>
      I selected this artifact because it demonstrates how I apply algorithmic thinking and structured data handling to build reliable
      software. While testing is often viewed as “supporting work,” this project highlights how data structures and repeatable test patterns
      can be used to improve code quality and reduce errors. This artifact also demonstrates my ability to create solutions that follow
      clear business rules through validation, which is critical in professional environments.

    <h2>Algorithms & Data Structures Demonstrated</h2>
    <p><strong>Key skills showcased in this enhancement include:</strong></p>
    <div>
      <span class="badge">Structured Collections (List)</span>
      <span class="badge">Data-Driven / Parameterized Testing</span>
      <span class="badge">Iterative Execution Pattern</span>
      <span class="badge">Validation & Edge Case Testing</span>
      <span class="badge">Clean, Maintainable Test Design</span>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Refactored repetitive unit tests into a more efficient <strong>data-driven structure</strong> by storing test cases in a collection
        and executing them through an iterative pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        Used a structured approach to reduce duplicated code and improve readability while still covering required validation rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strengthened reliability by validating expected behaviors across multiple test scenarios in a consistent way.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Enhancement Summary (What Improved)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before:</strong> Tests were more repetitive and required manual duplication for each scenario.</li>
      <li><strong>After:</strong> Tests follow a structured, scalable approach using collections and repeatable execution patterns, making the test suite easier to extend and maintain.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Cleaner code, improved organization, and stronger demonstration of data structures and algorithmic principles applied to testing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Outcomes Addressed</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement supports the Computer Science program outcome focused on designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic
      principles and appropriate computer science practices. It also supports professional communication by documenting the enhancement and
      presenting the work in an organized, portfolio-ready format.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Enhancing this artifact taught me the value of designing tests in a way that scales. I learned that using structured collections and
      repeatable test patterns can simplify test suites, reduce errors, and make future changes easier. The main challenge was ensuring that
      the refactoring preserved full test coverage while improving structure. This process strengthened my ability to think algorithmically
      and write cleaner, more maintainable code.
