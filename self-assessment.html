<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Completing the Computer Science program has transformed how I approach problems, design solutions, and communicate technical decisions.
Throughout this program I progressed from learning syntax and individual programming tasks to thinking like a software engineer focusing on maintainability, scalability, and usability.
My coursework and capstone artifacts demonstrate growth not only in coding ability, but also in planning, testing strategy, documentation, and professional communication.
</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
<h2>Collaboration and Communication</h2>
<p>
One of the most important skills I developed was the ability to explain technical concepts clearly.
Through project narratives, code reviews, and documentation, I learned to translate implementation decisions into understandable reasoning.
Recording and presenting my formal code review strengthened my communication skills and highlighted areas where verbalizing logic requires as much clarity as writing code.
This ability is essential when working with stakeholders, team members, and non-technical audiences.

  While many artifacts were developed independently, I applied collaborative practices such as structured testing, documentation clarity, and modular design to support future team scalability and code maintainability.
</p>

<section class="card">
<h2>Software Design and Engineering</h2>
<p>
My SYLTrack mobile application represents my growth in software design and engineering practices.
I improved the structure of the application by separating concerns, organizing navigation flow, and reducing tightly coupled logic.
Rather than focusing only on making the program work, I focused on making it maintainable and extensible.
These improvements demonstrate understanding of professional development practices such as modular design and usability considerations.
</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
<h2>Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
<p>
The CS 320 Appointment Service artifact demonstrates my ability to design structured solutions and efficient testing strategies.
I transitioned from repetitive manual testing toward organized, data-driven unit tests using collections.
This improved reliability while reducing redundancy and made the testing process easier to extend.
Through this artifact I demonstrated algorithmic reasoning and structured problem solving rather than simple implementation.
</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
<h2>Databases</h2>
<p>
Enhancing database functionality within SYLTrack strengthened my understanding of persistence, CRUD operations, and data integrity.
I improved schema structure, validation, and separation between user interface logic and storage logic.
This work demonstrates my ability to manage application data reliably across sessions while ensuring maintainability and scalability.
</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
<h2>Security and Professional Growth</h2>
<p>
Across all artifacts I consistently considered validation, data reliability, and error handling.
I developed a mindset focused on preventing issues rather than only fixing them.
The capstone process helped me evaluate software as a professional product rather than a classroom assignment.
</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This ePortfolio represents my transition into a software engineering professional ready to contribute in a real development environment.
I have developed skills in design, testing, data management, and communication that allow me to build reliable and maintainable applications.
More importantly, I have learned how to continuously evaluate and improve my work a skill that will support long-term growth throughout my career.
